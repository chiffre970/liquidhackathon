# Memory - Development Log

This file tracks key decisions and changes made during development.

## Project Rename
- Renamed entire project from PFMApp to "Vera" - personal finance assistant
- Updated all documentation, setup instructions, and file references
- Renamed PFMApp-source folder to Vera, PFMAppApp.swift to VeraApp.swift

## Project Setup
- Created basic iOS project structure with SwiftUI
- Set up tab navigation with Profile and Insights/Budget views
- Added LEAP SDK dependency in Package.swift
- Used green accent color for theme consistency
- Profile page shows import message as landing experience

## CSV Import Implementation
- Created Transaction model with ID, date, amount, description, counterparty, category
- Implemented CSVProcessor with flexible column detection for various CSV formats
- Added file import functionality with native iOS file picker
- Implemented transaction deduplication logic for merging multiple CSV files
- Created TransactionRow component showing amount (green/red), date, counterparty, category
- Added error handling with styled alerts matching green theme
- Fixed iOS file permission issue with startAccessingSecurityScopedResource()

## Xcode Project Setup
- Successfully created Xcode project with Core Data
- Basic app structure working - tabs, navigation, CSV import UI functional
- Need to copy updated source files and add missing InsightsView

## LFM2 Integration Implementation (2025-08-08)

### Architecture Foundation
- Created comprehensive configuration system (LFM2Config.swift, Environment.swift, LEAPConfig.swift)
- Implemented environment-based configs (dev/staging/prod) with different parameters
- Set up hyperparameterization for model tuning (temperature, topP, topK, maxTokens, etc.)

### Prompt Management System
- Created Prompts directory with specialized prompt templates:
  - TransactionParser.prompt - Extract merchant, amount, date, type from raw text
  - CategoryClassifier.prompt - Classify transactions into predefined categories
  - InsightsAnalyzer.prompt - Generate spending analysis and recommendations
  - BudgetNegotiator.prompt - Interactive budget advice generation
  - BudgetInsights.prompt - Budget optimization insights
- Built PromptManager.swift for dynamic prompt loading and template variable replacement
- Added fallback prompts for when files can't be loaded

### Telemetry & Monitoring
- Implemented TelemetryLogger.swift with:
  - Multi-level logging (debug, info, success, warning, error, performance)
  - Inference metrics tracking (input/output size, processing time, memory usage)
  - Console output with emojis for better visibility
  - OS-level logging integration
- Created PerformanceMonitor.swift for:
  - Session statistics tracking
  - Real-time inference monitoring
  - Memory usage tracking
  - Benchmark capabilities
  - Success rate calculations

### Core LFM2 Service
- Built LFM2Service.swift as main integration layer:
  - Placeholder for LEAP SDK integration (ready for real model)
  - Fallback to keyword-based categorization when AI unavailable
  - Batch processing support with concurrency control
  - Specialized methods for transaction categorization, spending analysis, budget negotiation
  - Memory management and monitoring

### Enhanced LFM2Manager
- Updated to use real LFM2Service instead of mock implementations
- Added telemetry throughout the processing pipeline
- Implemented batch transaction processing with progress tracking
- Fixed compilation issues:
  - Transaction uses `counterparty` not `merchant`
  - ChatMessage uses `isUser` boolean not `role` enum
  - Date handling fixed for transaction processing

### Cache Management
- Implemented CacheManager.swift with:
  - Two-tier caching (memory + disk)
  - Automatic expiration handling
  - Cache statistics tracking
  - Memory pressure handling
  - Specialized inference result caching

### Testing Infrastructure
- Created comprehensive LFM2ServiceTests.swift covering:
  - Basic inference
  - Transaction categorization
  - Batch processing
  - Cache functionality
  - Performance monitoring
  - Telemetry logging
  - Fallback mechanisms
  - End-to-end transaction processing

### Dependencies & Configuration
- LEAP SDK already configured in Package.swift
- Model path configuration ready for LFM2-700M model bundle
- Fallback mechanisms ensure app works without model

### Key Architectural Decisions
- Used protocol-based configuration for flexibility
- Implemented comprehensive fallback strategy for reliability
- Console telemetry for debugging during hackathon
- Cache layer to reduce redundant processing
- Batch processing with progress for better UX
- Memory monitoring to prevent crashes on device

### Next Steps for Full Integration
- Bundle actual LFM2-700M model when available
- Replace simulateInference with real LEAP SDK calls
- Test on physical device with real model
- Optimize memory usage based on telemetry
- Fine-tune hyperparameters based on performance metrics
