# Vera - Meeting Recording & Transcription App

## Overview
Vera is an AI-powered meeting assistant that records, transcribes, and intelligently enhances meeting notes using the LFM2 700M model for on-device processing.

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Basic recording infrastructure in place
- ‚úÖ Core Data models defined (Meeting entity)
- ‚úÖ MeetingRecordingService implemented
- üöß Real-time transcription integration needed
- üöß UI implementation in progress
- ‚è≥ LFM2 enhancement pipeline pending

## Phase 1: Foundation ‚úÖ COMPLETE

### Data Model ‚úÖ
- Meeting entity with all required fields
- ActionItem, KeyDecision, Question structs
- Core Data integration

### Recording Service ‚úÖ
- MeetingRecordingService with pause/resume
- Audio chunking (30-second intervals)
- Background processing preparation

## Phase 2: Transcription & UI üöß IN PROGRESS

### Real-time Transcription

```

### Insights Generation
**Priority: MEDIUM**
```swift
Identify:
- Key decisions made
- Important questions raised
- Follow-up items needed
- Risks or concerns
```

## Phase 4: Export & Templates ‚è≥ PENDING

### Export System
**Priority: LOW**

## Performance Targets
- Support 60+ minute recordings
- Real-time transcription with <2s delay
- LFM2 processing <30s per hour
- Search results <1s response
- App size <200MB (excluding model)

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Long recording sessions (>1 hour)
- [ ] Interruption handling (calls, notifications)
- [ ] Background processing
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring
- [ ] Transcription accuracy

## Deployment Checklist
- [ ] App permissions configured
- [ ] Privacy policy updated
- [ ] App Store description
- [ ] Screenshots prepared
- [ ] TestFlight beta testing

## Resources
- LFM2 Model: `Resources/LFM2/lfm_700m.bundle`
- Templates: `Resources/Templates/DefaultTemplates.json`
- Icons: System SF Symbols

## Meeting Templates (To Implement)
1. **1-on-1**: Agenda, Discussion, Action Items, Next Steps
2. **Stand-up**: Yesterday, Today, Blockers
3. **Client Meeting**: Objectives, Notes, Decisions, Follow-up
4. **Brainstorm**: Ideas, Evaluation, Next Steps
5. **Review**: Achievements, Improvements, Action Items

## Success Criteria
